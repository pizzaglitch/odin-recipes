        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat Oven to 400 degrees. In a small saucepan, prepare rice according to package instructions. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Cook onion until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add ground beef and cook, breaking up meat with a wooden spoon, until no longer pink, 6 minutes. Drain fat.</li>
            <li>Return beef mixture to skillet, then stir in cooked rice and diced tomatoes. Season with oregano, salt, and pepper. Let simmer until liquid has reduced slightly, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place peppers cut side-up in a 9"-x-13" baking dish and drizzle with oil. Spoon beef mixture into each pepper and top with Monterey jack, then cover baking dish with foil.</li>
            <li>Bake until peppers are tender, about 35 minutes. Uncover and bake until cheese is bubbly, 10 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Garnish with parsley before serving.</li>
            
        </ol>
